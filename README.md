Intro
---------------------
- Elysium is a P2P crypto-currency which is set to revolutionize the world by being the first Crypto-currency for Governments for Global Settlement Network and a Crypt-currency facilitating trade, commerce and investments worldwide through its disruptive technology  completely decentralized without the need for a central server or trusted parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directlywith each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending. 

- Elysium word comes from Ancient greek Ἠλύσιον πεδίον , which is a conception of the afterlife that developed over time , it expanded to include those chosen by the gods, the righteous, and the heroic, where they would remain after death, to live a blessed and happy life, and indulging in whatever employment they had enjoyed in life.

- In Homer’s Odyssey, Elysium is described as a paradise:

To the Elysian plain…where life is easiest for men. No snow is there, nor heavy storm, nor ever rain, but ever does Ocean send up blasts of the shrill-blowing West Wind that they may give cooling to men.


Development process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Elysium
development team members simply pulls it.

If it is a *more complicated or potentially controversial* change, then the patch
submitter will be asked to start a discussion with the devs and community.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.
Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't
match the project's coding conventions (see `doc/coding.txt`) or are
controversial.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/cuio/Elysium) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Elysium.

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test. Please be patient and help out, and
remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.



Setup
---------------------
You need the Qt4 run-time libraries to run Elysium-Qt. On Debian or Ubuntu:
	`sudo apt-get install libqtgui4`

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- bin/32/elysium-qt (GUI, 32-bit)
- bin/32/elysiumd (headless, 32-bit)
- bin/64/elysium-qt (GUI, 64-bit)
- bin/64/elysiumd (headless, 64-bit)
